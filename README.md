Just a dump of all the links which I get when I doom scroll.

Hope I don't put personal information here.

Plans (which will not happen - 90%):
1. Parse the links and use connectors for fetching data in screenshot forms - save in local.
2. Use VLM(?? not sure if there's a better way atm) to parse out info into 3 sections-> Books | Links/Blogs | Textual data or Images data
3. Download PDF through üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è - libgen?? or buy
4. Scan links/blogs and create a sorted order by increasing difficulty.
5. Create markdown files based on topic and assign image/text content into those.
6. Create a dashboard/knowledge graph with accounts, topics and resources I've copied from them
