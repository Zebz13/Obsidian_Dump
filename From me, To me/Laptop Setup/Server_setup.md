If you want deeper, rigorous treatments, start with these:

"Reed–Solomon Codes and Their Applications" — Shu Lin & Daniel J. Costello, Jr.
Classic book focused on RS theory and many applications. (Dense but authoritative.)

"Error Control Coding: Fundamentals and Applications" — S. Lin & D. J. Costello
Broader than RS (covers convolutional codes, BCH, RS, etc.). Good for systems-level understanding.

"The Art of Error Correcting Coding" — Robert H. Morelos-Zaragoza
Practical and readable; lots of worked examples.

"Introduction to Coding Theory" — van Lint
More mathematical, for deeper theoretical foundations.

For ZFS/RAID/implementation context (practical, not maths):

ZFS documentation, TrueNAS guides, and papers on modern erasure coding (look for references to "Reed-Solomon in storage" and "erasure codes vs replication").
